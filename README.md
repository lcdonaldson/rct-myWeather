This project was a good way to challenge myself and show a basic react project with a few modern react core concepts.

1. State management using mainly hooks.
2. Splitting component logic.
3. Making some external api calls to the openweathermap.org for displaying the data.
4. CSS styles in react native.
5. Have fun along the way!
